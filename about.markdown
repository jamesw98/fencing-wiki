# About the Site
This site is a collection of my knowledge as well as the knowledge of the other DFC coaches.

# About the Author 
I'm Jimmy Wallace, one of the coaches at Dunwoody Fencing Club. I have been fencing for 14 years, teaching beginner's lessons at Virginia Tech for 4 years, and coaching at DFC for the last year or so.  
This site is an upgraded version of a site I made back in 2019. This site has much more info, and with a much better layout.  
Outside of fencing I am a Computer Science student at Virginia Tech, graduating in Dec 2021.
