# About  
During the of summer 2021, I thought it would be a good idea to start documenting my, and other coaches, fencing knowledge.  

About me, I've been fencing for 14 years, coaching unofficially on and off for the past couple years. During the spring of 2020, I earned a coaching certification from USFCA. I am currently working on earning the next level of certification. I coach at Dunwoody Fencing Club as well as the Virginia Tech Fencing Club, at least for one more semester before I graduate.   

Currently I am working on getting more drills, exercises, warmups, etc to fill out more pages. 

Outside of fencing, I am a computer science student at Virginia Tech graduating in  December 2021.
