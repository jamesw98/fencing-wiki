# German Footwork Patterns
### Notes
* If you are doing this with newer fencers, I like to substitute fleche with advance or jump lunge
* I also like to substitute cross overs for check steps. 
    * Cross over back is fine, but I would not ever do cross forward
    * I will note these in each pattern
* If no recovery is specified after a lunge, that means recover back
* If fleche is not the end of a pattern, tell fencers not to run out the fleche, otherwise they will run out of space
