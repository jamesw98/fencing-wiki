# Fencing Drill Catalogue   
This is a collection of drills I think are good for any fencer. I've collected these over 14 years of fencing, but is by no means a compressive list. These names are also just what I have learned to call them over the years, so you might know these drills by a different name.    

Also note, I am an epee coach and fencer, I have touched the other weapons, but have little experience. So these drills probably have a bit of an epee bias, but I'm sure some, especially the footwork drills, can work for other weapons, but might need some adaptation.     

If you have any suggestions or additions, please email me at `jamesw98@vt.edu`, please mention this site in the subject if you do choose to email me.
