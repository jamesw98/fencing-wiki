# At Home Practice
Here is a collection of things you can do at home to help hone your fencing skills.

## Footwork
You can do pretty much any non-partner footwork drill at home! I know, surprising isn't it?  
If you want a set routine, here is my suggestion, and what I do to warmup at VT:
* Advances to a certain point, retreats back
    * small, slow footwork, you want to make sure you are doing it right
* Two advances, one retreat to a certain point, two retreats, one advance all the way back
    * the DFC classic
* Lunges to a certain point, small, quick retreats back
    * check your lunge before you recover
    * make sure your recovery is good as well, don't bring your arm back too soon
* Lunge recover back, lunge recover forward to a certain point, small, quick retreats back
* Once you feel like you're warmed up enough, shadow fence for 3 minutes
    * imagine your opponent in front of you, don't just do mindless footwork
    * if you want to go for 110%, go for 9 minutes to simulate a DE

## Blade Drills
Note that this isn't called bladework, since if you don't have a partner it is kind of hard to do traditional bladework drills, unless you have a practice dummy.   
Here are some of my favorite things to do with a weapon at home:
* Tennis Balls
    * hang a tennis ball from your ceiling, doorframe, etc
    * have it hang at about wrist height for an opponent
    * practice hitting it at various distances
    * this is one of my favorite accuracy drills, and if you want to make it even harder, go for a golf ball
        * note: this can damage your weapon, so maybe go for the [foam practice golf balls](https://www.amazon.com/GoSports-Foam-Golf-Practice-Balls/dp/B07VD3XK3C), but this may effect the drill since they are light, your mileage may vary
* Door Knob
    * find a round door knob
    * stand in en guarde with your point close, but not touching, the door knob
    * start circling the door knob, do not let it touch
    * after a while switch directions
    * this is great for training small actions
* Accuracy Pad/Lunging Pad
    * you can get something like this [lunging pad](https://www.leonpaulusa.com/mini-lunging-pad.html) from LP, or make something (an old pillow works decently)
    * hang it on your wall, and practice your accuracy
        * note: be very careful not to hit the wall, repairing drywall is no fun
