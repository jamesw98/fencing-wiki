# Recommended Fencing Books
This is by no means a comprehensive list, and is still being worked on.
## [Epee 2.5](https://www.amazon.com/Epee-2-5-Paradigm-Revised-Augmented/dp/0985444185) 
### by Johan Harmenberg
> Johan Harmenberg revolutionized epee fencing when he pioneered the New Fencing Paradigm that lets a fencer neutralize his opponentâ€™s superior technique. In this new, expanded edition of Epee 2.0, he hears comments from top competitors and gives his responses. The result is a book that covers the development of epee fencing from the 1970s to the present.

## [One Touch At A Time](https://www.amazon.com/One-Touch-At-Time-Psychological/dp/0965946878/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=one+touch+at+a+time&qid=1626633273&s=books&sr=1-1)
### by Aladar Kogler  
> A complete revision and substantial expansion of the first edition of Aladar Kogler's instant classic. This unique book looks at the key attributes that make elite fencers into world champions. Then it shows how you can develop these traits in yourself-- how you can strengthen yourself mentally to meet fencing's unique demands. Specific recommendations for your sense of distance, sense of tempo, bout preparation, bout psychology, and tactics. And there's much more, including a general program of mental preparation that extends to all aspects of life. Written especially for coaches but a must-read for all competitors.  

### Quick Review
From Coach Wallace
> The first time I read this book, it completely changed my mental game for fencing. It really helps you understand that you only need to focus on the current touche, and nothing else. I would recommend this for anyone who is in a fencing slump or anyone who finds that they get angry or upset as well as anyone who overthinks when they are fencing.  
  
## [The Care and Feeding of All Things Fencing](https://www.blue-gauntlet.com/The-care-and-feeding-of-all-things-fencing_p_4042.html) 
### by Michael Mergens
> The Care and Feeding of All Things Fencing" is a must have book for all aspiring and practicing Armorers, as well as fencers who wish to learn how to repair and maintain their equipment. While there are several books and websites that touch on certain aspects of Armoring, this is the FIRST book to cover the full range of equipment related to the Sport of Fencing; from weapons, to clothing, to scoring equipment. 

> It is written in an easy to read style, sprinkled with humor and anecdotes about the technical aspect of the sport that makes it both informative and entertaining 

### Quick Review
From Coach Wallace
> I have used this book countless times when teaching new fencers how to fix weapons, cords, you name it. It is also great to have around the club for when a reel breaks, floor cord stops working, or an epee is seemingly possessed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to fix their own gear (which should be everyone!)
