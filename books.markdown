# Recommended Fencing Books
This is by no means a comprehensive list, and is still being worked on.
## [Epee 2.5](https://www.amazon.com/Epee-2-5-Paradigm-Revised-Augmented/dp/0985444185) by Johan Harmenberg
> Johan Harmenberg revolutionized epee fencing when he pioneered the New Fencing Paradigm that lets a fencer neutralize his opponentâ€™s superior technique. In this new, expanded edition of Epee 2.0, he hears comments from top competitors and gives his responses. The result is a book that covers the development of epee fencing from the 1970s to the present.

> A complete revision and substantial expansion of the first edition of Aladar Kogler's instant classic. This unique book looks at the key attributes that make elite fencers into world champions. Then it shows how you can develop these traits in yourself-- how you can strengthen yourself mentally to meet fencing's unique demands. Specific recommendations for your sense of distance, sense of tempo, bout preparation, bout psychology, and tactics. And there's much more, including a general program of mental preparation that extends to all aspects of life. Written especially for coaches but a must-read for all competitors.  

### Quick Review
From Coach Wallace
> The first time I read this book, it completely changed my mental game for fencing. It really helps you understand that you only need to focus on the current touche, and nothing else. I would recommend this for anyone who is in a fencing slump or anyone who finds that they get angry or upset as well as anyone who overthinks when they are fencing.
