## The Ducks
> "Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, at Dunwoody Fencing Club we do not fence for the honor, the glory, the medals, or the ratings, although we earn all these, we fence for... the ducks"

As far as I know, this is the longest running tradition at DFC, and my personal favorite. After every major tournament, RYC, SYC, RJCC, NAC, Nationals, etc and on major life occasions such as graduation, DFC fencers are presented with a rubber duck, usually with an appropriate theme for the location/occasion. If you have been fencing at DFC as long as I have, you will amass a small army of them.     

Below is my (slightly dusty) collection of ducks
